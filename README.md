# HoI4 True NATO icons

HoI4 uses a weird mixture of NATO-icons and their own self-made ones. Some of them are just plain incorrect (like the Tanks having lines instead of letters for their variants), but then there are also some like Anti-Air using the symbol for Anti-Tank, with Anti-Tank being completely made up.

This mod aims to correct this - especially since other mods of its kind are outdated, or incorrect as well.
